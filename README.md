# My_twitter_Bot

What does the code do ?

-->This code sets up authentication for Twitter and OpenAI APIs, defines functions to generate images and poems using OpenAI's DALL-E and GPT-3 models, and listens for 
new mentions or direct messages on Twitter that contain the handle "@TwAI".

-->When a new message is received, the code extracts the message text, generates an image and a poem using the defined functions, and posts the result as a reply to 
the original message on Twitter. The generated image and poem are created based on the input prompt provided in the message.

-->The code also includes error handling and logging functionality to help diagnose any issues that may arise during the execution of the program.
